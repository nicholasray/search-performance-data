# Search performance (Vue vs. Legacy) assets and data

Used for a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yqriwmHLgWJCLqmalebACp3Y09FVjJSHzt5WuR-nxVA/edit?usp=sharing) I gave at an offsite at the Wikimedia Foundation. I also converted this presentation to a [blog article](https://www.nray.io/blog/analyzing-search-performance) available on my site.

Also see datasheet I made at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cTvsAEoqbMdZiX7VSn_5Zn_4887806Xh6szYq16nJgs/edit?usp=sharing
